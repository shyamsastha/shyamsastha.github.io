## About Me

Hello there! I'm Sastha Srinivasan. A PhD student in the Center of Excellence in Human-Centered Computing and the Department of Computer Science at [IIIT-Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/), co-advised by [Prof. Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pushpendra) and [Prof. Mohan Kumar](https://www.rit.edu/directory/mjkvcs-mohan-kumar). With 3+ years of hands-on experience, my doctoral research focuses on leveraging _AI/ML_ with _sensing_ to create social impact in proactive health and wellbeing suitable to the _Collective Care_ settings prevalent in India. I have previously worked as a _Programmer Analyst_ at Sara’s Inc. and Unanu, leading cloud products, analytics dashboards, and ML/AI pipeline deployments that saved time and money across industries. I hold a Master's in _Computer Systems Engineering (specializing in IoT)_ from [Northeastern University](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/cyber-physical-systems-ms/) under the guidance of [Prof. Peter O'Reilly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/oreilly-peter/), where I also interned at _Bose Corporation_, developing an automated testing suite for smart home security. Passionate about affective computing, I also work on side projects that intersect AI with education, and in my downtime, you’ll find me enjoying strategy games, tabletop RPGs, or reading with a cup of cocoa in hand when I do not explore the world.

## Research Interests
*   Wearables: Different modalities for sustainable proactive monitoring.
*   AI/LLMs: Exploring new ways to fill gaps in public health information.
*   RAI: Responsible AI for social impact through sustainability.
