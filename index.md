## About Me

Hello there! I'm Sastha Srinivasan, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate (Thesis: HCAI for Collective Care) at [IIIT-Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/), co-advised by [Prof. Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pushpendra) and [Prof. Mohan Kumar](https://www.rit.edu/directory/mjkvcs-mohan-kumar). Through my doctoral research, I focus on leveraging AI/ML with sensing to create social impact in proactive health and wellbeing, suitable for Collective Care settings prevalent in societies like India.

By investigating how people seek, interpret, and share health information, I design culturally aligned engagement systems and develop GenAI-powered tools to make health information more accessible and usable, integrating ubiquitous computing, human–computer interaction, and artificial Intelligence. Through my research, I aim to create deployable, context-sensitive technologies that bridge the gap between algorithmic innovation and real-world care practices.

My prior industrial experience in leading successful cloud products, analytics dashboards, and ML/AI pipeline deployments supports my ability to think at scale in my research. Prior to that, I completed my Master's in _Computer Systems Engineering (specializing in IoT)_ from [Northeastern University](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/cyber-physical-systems-ms/) under the guidance of [Prof. Peter O'Reilly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/oreilly-peter/), where I also interned at _Bose Corporation_, developing an automated testing suite for smart home security.

Passionate about interdisciplinary computing research, I also work on side projects that intersect AI with computing education. In my downtime, you’ll find me enjoying strategy games _(digital and tabletop)_, reading with a cup of cocoa, or out exploring places.

## Research Interests
