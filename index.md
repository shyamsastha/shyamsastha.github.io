## About Me

Hello there! I'm Sastha Srinivasan, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate (Thesis: HCAI for Collective Care) at [IIIT-Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/), co-advised by [Prof. Pushpendra Singh](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pushpendra) and [Prof. Mohan Kumar](https://www.rit.edu/directory/mjkvcs-mohan-kumar). With 3+ years of hands-on experience, my doctoral research focuses on leveraging _AI/ML_ with _sensing_ to create social impact in proactive health and wellbeing suitable to the _Collective Care_ settings prevalent in Global South contexts like India by integrating ubiquitous computing, human–computer interaction, and artificial Intelligence. I investigate how people seek, interpret, and share health information, design culturally aware engagement systems such as TV-based interactive care for older adults, and develop GenAI-powered tools for making health information more accessible. Through my research, I aim to create deployable, context-sensitive technologies that bridge the gap between algorithmic innovation and real-world care practices.

My prior industrial experiences leading cloud products, analytics dashboards, and ML/AI pipeline deployments that saved time and money across industries support my ability to think for scale (if needed) in my research. I hold a Master's in _Computer Systems Engineering (specializing in IoT)_ from [Northeastern University](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/cyber-physical-systems-ms/) under the guidance of [Prof. Peter O'Reilly](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/oreilly-peter/), where I also interned at _Bose Corporation_, developing an automated testing suite for smart home security. Passionate about interdisciplinary computing research, I also work on side projects that intersect AI with computing education. In my downtime, you’ll find me enjoying strategy games _(digital and tabletop)_, reading with a cup of cocoa, or out exploring places.

## Research Interests
*   Wearables: Different modalities for sustainable proactive monitoring.
*   AI/LLMs: Exploring new ways to fill gaps in public health information.
